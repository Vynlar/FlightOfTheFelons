### FIREFOX vs. CHROME
I realize that the game is supposed to work in Firefox, however it seems to act weird in certain versions and computers. On my laptop, the game has issues using Firefox 41 but not in Firefox 42, where as on my desktop it does not work at all. This is a recent issue, as it worked just fine when the number of sprites on the screen was lower. Running a local web server and using Chrome makes it work on both of my computers. I apologize that it does not meet the requirements, but this caught me off guard a bit. Hopefully you don't mind running that web server and playing it in Chrome. I will work on getting that fixed for the Thursday class.
