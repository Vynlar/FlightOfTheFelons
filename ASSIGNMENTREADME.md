# Programming Assignment - April 8

_Note: This version might be out of date by the time you are looking at it, which is fine because it has everything that is required for the assignment, but the latest code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vynlar/FlightOfTheFelons)._

## Extra Credit Notes
1. I didn't draw out collision lines, but I did implement collision with the buildings.
2. I don't have any enemies yet (_if ever_), but I did include a working player (_temporary art_). There are quite a few known issues that will be fixed as I keep working.
